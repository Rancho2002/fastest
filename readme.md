# Weather Information Retrieval

This Markdown file demonstrates how to retrieve weather information for a specific city using the `requests` library in Python. The code fetches the weather information for the city "Kolkata" from the [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) website and prints the response text.

## Architecture Flow Description

The architectural flow for retrieving weather information using the `requests` library is as follows:

1. Define the city for which you want to retrieve weather information. In this example, we use the city "Kolkata".

2. Construct the URL by formatting the city name into the `https://wttr.in/{city}` format.

3. Use the `requests.get()` function to send a GET request to the constructed URL.

4. Retrieve the response using the `.text` attribute of the response object.

5. Print the response text, which contains the weather information for the specified city.

## Code Example

```python
import requests

city = "Kolkata"

url = "https://wttr.in/{}".format(city)

res = requests.get(url)

print(res.text)

```

## Using GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot assist me in writing code by providing intelligent code suggestions and completions based on the context of your code. In the provided code snippet, GitHub Copilot have assisted in several ways:

1. Autocomplete: When I start typing a line of code, GitHub Copilot suggests possible completions based on the context. For example, when I started typing `import requests`, Copilot have likely suggested completing the import statement.

2. Function Signature: When defining the `fetch_weather` function, Copilot have helped me generate the function, including the input parameter `city_name` and the return type `dict`.

3. API Integration: Copilot have provided suggestions for using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. It have suggested me the `get` method for fetching weather data from the API endpoint and handling the response.

4. Exception Handling: When handling the response from the weather API, Copilot have suggested including an `if-else` block to check the status code and raise an exception if it's not 200. It have also provided suggestions for error handling and displaying appropriate error messages.

5. Parsing JSON: Copilot have suggested me using the `json` method on the response object to extract the JSON data and convert it into a Python dictionary.

6. Extracting Weather Information: When extracting specific weather information from the JSON data, such as location, sunrise, sunset, temperature, etc., Copilot have provided suggestions for accessing the relevant nested keys and handling cases where the data might be missing.

7. Formatting and Printing: Copilot might have assisted in formatting the weather information and generating the output strings for displaying the weather forecast. It have suggested me using f-strings for string interpolation and provided guidance on formatting numeric values.

Overall, GitHub Copilot aims to assist developers by generating relevant code suggestions based on the context, which can help me and other developers to improve productivity and reduce the time required to write code.

To benefit from GitHub Copilot, you can also install the Copilot extension in your preferred code editor and enable it to provide code suggestions while you write. It can learn from your coding style and adapt to your preferences over time, making it an even more powerful assistant in your development workflow.

With GitHub Copilot, you can write code faster, more accurately, and with reduced cognitive load, enabling you to focus on solving higher-level problems and building better software.
